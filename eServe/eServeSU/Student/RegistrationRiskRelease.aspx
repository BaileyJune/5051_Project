            1. Seattle University does not control the way in which the community agency or partner (“Agency”) is structured or operates. In granting academic credit for this Service-Learning experience, the University affirms that the experience is an appropriate curricular option for students in an undergraduate program of study and worthy of Seattle University credit, but makes no other assurances, express or implied, about the Agency.

            2. I understand and acknowledge that by participating in an academic Service-Learning placement, I am being provided with an opportunity for personal growth and a real world educational experience. I also understand and acknowledge there are certain risks inherent in my participation in this Service-Learning placement including, but not limited to, risks arising from:

 Commuting to and from the placement site;

 Providing services to members of the community or their family members who may become unpredictable, angry or violent;

 Exposure to communicable or infectious diseases, bodily fluids, medicinal preparations, or toxic substances; and

 Working in unfamiliar surroundings, neighborhoods or communities.

I agree to assume those risks, whether foreseen or unforeseen, that are beyond the reasonable control of Seattle University or the staff at the Agency.

            4. I acknowledge and agree that it is my responsibility to understand and follow the Agency’s safety procedures and safety guidelines as described by my Agency supervisor to minimize risks and enhance my safety while placed at the Agency. I understand that I will not be forced to engage in assignments at the Service-Learning site in which my safety or well being is at risk. I agree to report to my Agency supervisor, my professors, and the Center for Service and Community Engagement any incidents in which I am or feel threatened or unsafe while at the Service-Learning site.

            5. I understand that in connection with my Service-Learning placement, I must have the ability to interpret, adapt, and apply safety procedures and guidelines. I must be able to react calmly and effectively in emergency situations and have the ability to establish and maintain effective relationships with a variety of populations, agency staff, faculty, social work or service professionals, and the public.

            6. If I have a physical, mental, or sensory condition which could affect my ability to participate fully in a Service-Learning experience, or to perform the essential duties and responsibilities associated with the Service-Learning assignment, then it is my responsibility to timely notify the Seattle University Learning Center/Disabilities Services (206.296.5740) to discuss reasonable accommodations or modifications.

            7. When I am participating in the Service-Learning activities, I am doing so as a Seattle University student, and not as an employee of the Agency. Therefore, if I am injured or hurt or become ill in connection with my Service-Learning assignment, I understand that I am not eligible for workers compensation insurance or benefits.

            8. If I require emergency medical treatment as a result of an accident or illness arising during the Service-Learning experience, I consent to such treatment. I understand that Seattle University does not provide health or accident insurance for Service-Learning participants. I agree to be financially responsible for any medical bills that I may incur resulting from emergency or other medical treatment. I acknowledge that I am required to purchase student insurance through the University or provide proof of sufficient insurance coverage.

            10. I understand that if I use my personal vehicle for the benefit of the Agency with whom I perform my Service-Learning, Seattle University has no liability for personal injury or property damage that may result from that use.

            11. I understand that the responsibilities and circumstances of an off-campus Service-Learning opportunity require a standard of professional decorum. Therefore, I indicate my willingness to understand and conform to the standards, policies, and procedures of the Agency. I further understand that it is important to the success of the Service-Learning program and the continuance of future Service-Learning participants that students observe standards of conduct that would not compromise Seattle University in the eyes of individuals and organizations with which it has dealings, and I acknowledge the Center for Service and Community Engagement’s responsibility for setting rules and interpreting conduct for this purpose. I agree that the University or the Agency has the right to terminate me from my Service-Learning placement because of conduct that might bring the program into disrepute or that violates Seattle University or Agency policies. All final resolutions of my academic status in such situations will be made by the University.

            12. Seattle University obtains or asks others on its behalf to obtain Background Checks for criminal convictions and civil findings related to violence, abuse, and/or neglect against minors or vulnerable adults, from a consumer reporting agency. These reports assist us in evaluating individuals for volunteer and service learner placement with Seattle University’s partner schools and organizations. If I am working with a site that requires a Background Check (listed in the site’s position description), I understand that I will receive an email from TalentWise with an online link and instructions for applying for my Background Check. I understand that the Center for Service and Community Engagement may share results of my Background Check with my service-learning site supervisor. If I fail to complete the Background Check application within 48 hours of receiving email instructions, I understand that my registration with this service site may be dropped. I understand that I have an ongoing obligation to report any future criminal convictions or civil adjudications to the Center for Service and Community Engagement while I am participating in service. I understand that this Background Check does not take the place of any application processes that my service site requires.

            13. If, in connection with my participation in the Service-Learning experience, I suffer any injury, illness, loss, expense, damage, or death, that is beyond the reasonable control of Seattle University, I agree not to sue and agree to release and forever discharge Seattle University and its governing board, officers, administrators, agents, faculty, and employees from any and all claims, demands, causes of action, costs, or expenses that can or may arise from my participation in Service-Learning. This release and covenant not to sue is binding on my family, my heirs, my personal representative, agents, and assigns.
